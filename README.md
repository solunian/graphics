# Graphics!

Some graphics/photos I've made! I am using [affinity software](https://affinity.serif.com) instead of the blisteringly expensive Adobe Creative Cloud.
I'm using GitHub to transfer the files easily from my laptop to my desktop, and also everything is "backed up" that way.

## Dev Notes

- git will ignore everything in `exports/` and `ignore/` directories, including those named that in the subdirectories
- licensing stuff is kinda fun!
